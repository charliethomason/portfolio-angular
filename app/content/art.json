      "description": "My fiancé Amanda's favorite bird is a Brown Pelican, and her favorite place is Venice, Italy. So, in way, this is sort-of a portrait of her. I gave this to her as a (late) Christmas present in January 2016 and now hangs in our living room. Venice was one of the most challenging places I've ever painted — due to the colors, lighting, small details, and different building heights. Also, the Pelican is one of the most most challenging birds I've painted — due to its colors and strange body shape. This image could never happen in real life, because there are no Brown Pelicans in Italy (there are some other types of pelicans, but they're very rare). Also, this image will not appear in my forthcoming Chicago bird art book, because there are no pelicans in Chicago either."

      "description": "This was given to my Dad as a Christmas 2015 gift. Growing up in New Jersey, my Dad and I would go to a nearby pond where we'd see ospreys and kingfishers. I love the size contrast between these two birds, and yet how similar they are. They both eat fish, yet obviously not the same size fish, so they can live peacefully near each other. It was also a lot of fun to paint the Belted Kingfisher's head, which sort-of resembles a mohawk (this being the female Kingfisher). In the future, I plan to do a larger portrait of a kingfisher."

      "description": "This painting of Jim Clark driving his iconic Lotus Formula One car was given to my Dad as a Christmas present in 2014. I decided to post it on my website today (March 4, 2015), as it would have been Jim’s 79th birthday. He is considered by some to be the greatest F1 driver in history. This portrait depicts Clark driving the Lotus 49 at the 1968 British Grand Prix — the last race Clark ever won (or finished) before his untimely death. The Lotus 49 featured a V8 Ford-Cosworth DFV engine, which is one of the most successful engines in F1 history. This was one of the first paintings of a car I had done in many years and I’m very pleased with it."
